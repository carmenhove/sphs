This repro (formally published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10689670)) contains the de-identified data and code used in the peer-reviewed publication ["Variation in maternal lactation practices associated with changes in diurnal maternal inflammation"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54963-4). To duplicate the analyses, download the "data", "R", and "scripts" folders and put into an R project. All scripts should be run in order (01_, 02_, and so on).
